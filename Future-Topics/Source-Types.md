## Types of Sources
A **pump** can be designed in certain ways. Let's take a **hand-operated** pump for instance. It pumps water as long as I **turn** the **crank**. There is no **control** over **pressure** or **flow** of any kind. Of course flow rate and pressure **depend** on how **hard** I crank it. And that is just a **casual** for how much **power** I apply. But I do not keep track of one or the other.

I could design an **automated** pump though, that has **control** over the **pressure** and keeps it at a **constant** level - **regardless** of how much water I draw off. Or to put in another way: *the **pressure** is **independent** of the **flow**.* The more water I draw within a certain amount if time, the **harder** it becomes for the pump to *maintain* the **pressure**. Consequently, the more **mechanical power** the pump draws.

An alternative pump design would **monitor** the **flow** and keep it **constant** over time - **regardless** of how hard it is to force the water into the connected pipe. Or in other words: *the **flow** is **independent** of the **pressure**.* The thinner the pipes are, the higher the pressure must be and the harder it is for the pump to *maintain* the **flow**. Consequently, the more **mechanical power** the pump draws.
