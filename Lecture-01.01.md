## The Fundamentals
But what do I mean with *fundamentals*? To me, there are at least **three** fundamental **concepts** that create a solid foundation to the novice or *noob* in electronics:
* Energy
* Voltage and Current
* Cause and Effect

### Energy
I define energy as the **potential** for **action** or the ability to do **work**. Whenever work is carried out, it is **allways** accompanied by the **conversion** and, **simultaneously**, the **transfer** of **energy**. [...]

### Voltage and Current
To know the difference between voltage and current is probably the mother of all understanding in electronics! The example of a water circuit makes a very good **analogy** for beginners! [...] 

### Cause and Effect
[...]
