# Voltage Sources
So far we have just described a voltage source by an equivalent - the water pump - and kept it that way. it is time to demystify electrical sources in gernal in order to lay the gound work for future lecture and, more importantly, practical application. But before we do that, let us stick with that equivalent for a little more.

### Counter Forces
A hand operated water pump for instance builds up pressure as long as you crank the handle. The harder you crank, the more pressure you build and vice versa. The more pressure you have or want, the harder you have to operate it. You will soon notice a counter force that puts a limit to your effords. That limit is basically defined by your personal fitness level. The counter force allways acts against you. Allways and in every kind of source. Otherwise we could create energy out of thin air! You have to perform a certain work and that means you spent energy.

In theory you don't spent any energy just buy building up pressure until you move any water or even drive a water wheel with it. But the pump faces intrinsic friction losses. So does any electrical generator. Hence, we are not so far from the thruth with our water model.

#### Open Loop Voltage
The pressure we build up before we open any valves to let the water flow through the pipes, is equivalent to the voltage of any electrical source before we connect its terminals to a circuit. It is called the **Open Loop Voltage V<sub>0</sub>**.

### Are we violating *Kirchhoff's Voltage Law?*
Let us analyse what happens in the moment we connect a water circuit to a water pump. When the valve opens, the water will experience a relaxation and the pressure will slightly drop. You can imagin a standing crowd of people cramped together before the start of a demonstration. The crowd on the move is not as packed as the standing pulk of people.

Originally we derived *Kirchhoff's Voltage Law* so nicely with that water model. It states that the sum of all voltages in a circuit is zero. Or put another way: The source voltage equals the sum of all voltage (serial) drops in the connected circuit. And I am unsing this pressure drops with out any doubt. If we monitor the pressure at the pump and across the pipes and any water wheel connected to them, we will still be able to make this summation correctly at any time. And in fact the same holds true for any electrical source.

But what about the **static case**, when the valves of the pump are closed or when the source is disconnected from the load? It appears that the opposing pressure or voltage drops were missing and we had a pup pressure or a source voltage only! So what is there left to sum up to zero? To anwer that, let us focus on voltages only for the moment.

Like before, let us draw a voltage indicator in form of an arrow left to our source, from top to bottom. Let us name it **V<sub>s</sub>** for source voltage. And now we draw another indicator to the right of our source, from the top terminal to the bottom terminal or from plus to minus respectively. We name it **V<sub>0</sub>** for open loop voltage. On first glance **V<sub>0</sub>** looks like an exact duplicate of **V<sub>s</sub>**.

#### Closed loops
Remember last time, how we rearranged our arrows of source voltage and voltage drops? **V<sub>s</sub>** appeared to be parallel to the sum of the Voltage drops in the wires and the load resistor. But after a deft rearrangement we figured that the source is **opposing** the other voltages but is equal in magnitude! The same rule applies here. **V<sub>s</sub>** and **V<sub>0</sub>** are just **vectors** in an **one-dimensional** space that is curved back into itself - in form of a **closed loop**. Or in other words - a **circuit**. So mathematically we get **V<sub>s</sub>** = **V<sub>0</sub>** => **V<sub>s</sub>** - **V<sub>0</sub>** = 0 - quod erat demonstrandum!

#### Tighten the Grip
As allways, I would like to take a more intuitive approach to finalize this. Let us go back to our water circuit that consists of a pump and a water wheel connected to the pump by two pipes.



## Types of Sources
A **pump** can be designed in certain ways. Let's take a **hand-operated** pump for instance. It pumps water as long as I **turn** the **crank**. There is no **control** over **pressure** or **flow** of any kind. Of course flow rate and pressure **depend** on how **hard** I crank it. And that is just a **casual** for how much **power** I apply. But I do not keep track of one or the other.

I could design an **automated** pump though, that has **control** over the **pressure** and keeps it at a **constant** level - **regardless** of how much water I draw off. Or to put in another way: *the **pressure** is **independent** of the **flow**.* The more water I draw within a certain amount if time, the **harder** it becomes for the pump to *maintain* the **pressure**. Consequently, the more **mechanical power** the pump draws.

An alternative pump design would **monitor** the **flow** and keep it **constant** over time - **regardless** of how hard it is to force the water into the connected pipe. Or in other words: *the **flow** is **independent** of the **pressure**.* The thinner the pipes are, the higher the pressure must be and the harder it is for the pump to *maintain* the **flow**. Consequently, the more **mechanical power** the pump draws.
