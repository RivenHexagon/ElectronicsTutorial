## Definition of Resistance

In Lecture [L25-02](https://github.com/RivenHexagon/ElectronicsTutorial/blob/main/L25-02.md), we talked about different forms of **energy**.

For each type, we had two key equations:
- One to calculate the **quantity**, or amount, of energy.
- One to calculate the **power**, meaning how much energy is transferred or converted **over time**.

In all cases, one factor stood out —  
because it appeared in **both** equations.

What I previously called the *driver* is formally known as the **effort variable**.  
It’s the thing we need to "push" in order to make energy flow.

In physics and engineering, especially in network theory, thermodynamics, and system modeling, we use two fundamental terms:

- **Effort variables** — also called generalized forces
- **Flow variables** — also called generalized flows

Typically:
- **Energy** is **Effort × Flow**, integrated **over time**.
- **Power** is **Effort × Flow** at any given instant.



Here’s how this idea connects across different types of energy:

| Domain                  | Effort                     | Flow                      | Power = Effort × Flow      |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Mechanical (rotational)  | Torque (Nm)                 | Angular velocity (rad/s)   | Torque × ω                 |
| Mechanical (linear)      | Force (N)                   | Velocity (m/s)             | Force × v                  |
| Electrical               | Voltage (V)                 | Current (A)                | Voltage × Current          |
| Thermal                  | Temperature difference (ΔT) | Entropy flow (dS/dt)        | ΔT × (entropy flow)        |
| Hydraulic                | Pressure (Pa)               | Volumetric flow rate (m³/s) | Pressure × Flow            |

With this understanding, we can now give a general definition of **resistance**:

> **Resistance is the effort needed to drive a certain amount of flow.**


### Example with Thermal Resistance

Lets take a water boiler of 80 l capacity, a storage temperature of 70°C and a styrofoam insulation.

The "driving force" or **efford variable** is the **temperature difference**:

$\Delta T = 70^\circ\text{C} - 20^\circ\text{C} = 50\, \text{K}$


With a given surface area and thermal conductivity of styrofoam one can estimate the **thermal resistance** $R_\text{th}$ of about 2.86 K/W.

The heat loss (power) through the insulation is then:

$P = \frac{\Delta T}{R_{\text{th}}}$

$P = \frac{50}{2.857} \approx 17.5\, \text{W}$

The heater loses about 17.5 Watts continuously just to maintain the 70°C water against 20°C surroundings.

To match the structure above:

* **Temperature difference** $\Delta T$ is the **effort variable**
* **Heat loss** $P_\text{th}$ is the **flow variable**

* **Thermal resistance** $R_\text{th}$ is the "difficulty" or "obstacle" to overcome

#### Supplement: Energy lost over 24 h:

$E = P \times t$

where:
- $P = 17.5\, \text{W}$
- $t = 24\, \text{h} = 86400\, \text{s}$

Thus:

$E = 17.5\, \text{W} \times 86400\, \text{s} = 1,512,000\, \text{J} = 1,512\, \text{kJ}$


Convert to kilowatt-hours:

$E = \frac{1,512\, \text{kJ}}{3600\, \text{kJ/kWh}} \approx 0.42\, \text{kWh/day}$


## Electrical Resistance

Or, for example in electricity:

> **Resistance is the effort (voltage) required to make a certain current flow.**

This matches the structure above, where:

* Voltage is the effort variable,
* Current is the flow variable,
* Resistance is the "difficulty" or "obstacle" you need to overcome.
