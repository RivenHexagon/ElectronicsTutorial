* What is better
  * One resistor for two LEDs
  * One resistor for each LED

* Given a toaster ratet for 115 V and 800 W
  * calculate its resistance (use P = U*I and R = U/I)
  * can I use a series resistor to use it on 230 V
  * -> two toasters in a row

* Can I use a series resistor to make an electonic device work on a higher voltage than it's rated for?
