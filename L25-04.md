# Lecture L25-04

## Definition of Resistance

In Lecture [L25-02](https://github.com/RivenHexagon/ElectronicsTutorial/blob/main/L25-02.md), we talked about different forms of **energy**.

For each type, we had two key equations:
- One to calculate the **quantity**, or amount, of energy.
- One to calculate the **power**.

In all cases, one factor stood out — because it appeared in **both** equations.

I previously called it the *driver*. It’s the thing that gives the "push" in order to make energy flow between two elements. It is always characterized by two variables, of which the product is **power**.

In physics and engineering, especially in network theory, thermodynamics, and system modeling, these variables are called **Effort** and
**Flow**.

Typically:
- **Energy** is **Effort × Flow**, integrated **over time** (E = P × t).
- **Power** is **Effort × Flow**, or energy **per time** (P = E / t).

 Here’s how this idea connects across different types of energy:

| Domain                    | Effort                     | Flow                        | Power = Effort × Flow      |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Mechanical (rotational)  | Torque (Nm)                 | Angular velocity (rad/s)    | Torque × ω                 |
| Mechanical (linear)      | Force (N)                   | Velocity (m/s)              | Force × v                  |
| **Electrical**           | **Voltage (V)**             | **Current (A)**             | **Voltage × Current**      |
| Thermal                  | Temperature difference (ΔT) | Entropy flow (dS/dt)        | ΔT × (entropy flow)        |
| Hydraulic                | Pressure (Pa)               | Volumetric flow rate (m³/s) | Pressure × Flow            |


With this understanding, we can now give a general definition of **resistance**:

> **Resistance is the effort needed to drive a certain amount of flow.**


## Examples

> ### Example with Thermal Resistance
> 
> Lets take a water boiler of 80 l capacity, a storage temperature of 70°C and a styrofoam insulation.
> 
> The "driving force" or **efford variable** is the **temperature difference**:
> 
> $Delta T = 70^\circ\text{C} - 20^\circ\text{C} = 50 \text{K}$
> 
> With a given surface area and thermal conductivity of styrofoam one can [estimate](https://github.com/RivenHexagon/ElectronicsTutorial/blob/main/L25-04-aside.md) the **thermal resistance** $R_\text{th}$ of about 2.86 K/W.
> 
> The heat loss (power) through the insulation is then:
> 
> $P = \frac{\Delta T}{R_{\text{th}}}$
> 
> $P = \frac{50}{2.857} \approx 17.5\, \text{W}$
> 
> The heater loses about 17.5 Watts continuously just to maintain the 70°C water against 20°C surroundings.
> 
> To match the structure above:
> 
> * **Temperature difference** $\Delta T$ is the **effort variable**
> * **Heat loss** $P_\text{th}$ is the **flow variable**
> 
> * **Thermal resistance** $R_\text{th}$ is the "difficulty" or "obstacle" to overcome
> 
> #### Supplement: Energy lost over 24 h:
> 
> $E = P \times t$
> 
> where:
> - $P = 17.5\, \text{W}$
> - $t = 24\, \text{h} = 86400\, \text{s}$
> 
> Thus:
> 
> $E = 17.5\, \text{W} \times 86400\, \text{s} = 1,512,000\, \text{J} = 1,512\, \text{kJ}$
> 
> Convert to kilowatt-hours:
> 
> $E = \frac{1,512\, \text{kJ}}{3600\, \text{kJ/kWh}} \approx 0.42\, \text{kWh/day}$

## Electrical Resistance

***CONSTRUCTION SITE***

* spezifischer elektrischer widerstand und spezifischer thermischer Widerstand vergleich aside
* LED als 'black box'

Or, for example in electricity:

> **Resistance is the effort (voltage) required to make a certain current flow.**

Note the equivalence: 
> Thermal resistance = Kelvin / Watt  
  Electrical resistance = Volt / Ampere  
  thus:  
  General resistance = Effort / Flow


This matches the structure above, where:

* Voltage is the effort variable,
* Current is the flow variable,
* Resistance is the "difficulty" or "obstacle" you need to overcome.
