### Step 1: Approximate the tank size

We need to estimate the surface area $A$.

80 liters = $0.08\,\text{m}^3$ of water.

Let's assume the boiler is a vertical cylinder. A typical small boiler has:

Diameter $d \approx 45\,\text{cm} = 0.45\,\text{m}$

Height $h \approx 0.5$ to $0.6\,\text{m}$.

Volume $V$ of a cylinder is:

$V = \pi \times \left(\dfrac{d}{2}\right)^2 \times h$

Let's check:

$V = \pi \times (0.225\,\text{m})^2 \times 0.5\,\text{m} \approx 0.08\,\text{m}^3$

✅ Ok, it fits.

Now, the surface area $A$ (including top and bottom):

$A = 2\pi r h + 2\pi r^2$

$= 2\pi (0.225\,\text{m})(0.5\,\text{m}) + 2\pi(0.225\,\text{m})^2$

$\approx 0.707\,\text{m}^2$

So the total surface area is about **0.7 m²**.


### Step 2: Find real-world insulation values

Let's assume the boiler is insulated with polyurethane foam, which has a typical thermal conductivity:

$\lambda_{\text{PU foam}} \approx 0.025\,\text{W}/(\text{m}\cdot\text{K})$

Suppose the insulation layer around the boiler is about:

$d = 5\,\text{cm} = 0.05\,\text{m}$

Then, the thermal resistance $R_{\text{th}}$ of the insulation can be approximated by:

$R_{\text{th}} = \dfrac{d}{\lambda \times A}$

where:
- $d$ = thickness of insulation (m)
- $\lambda$ = thermal conductivity (W/(m·K))
- $A$ = surface area (m²) through which heat flows
