## Definition of Resistance

In Lecture L25-02 we talked about forms of **energy**. We had one equation to calculate the **quantity**, or the amout, of the specific type of energy. And we had an equation for the **power** as the **amount** of energy being transfered or converted **over time**.

For any type of energy one factor sticks out, since it appears in **both** equations.

In physics and engineering, especially in network theory, thermodynamics and system modeling, there are two fundamental terms called:

* **Effort variables** (or generalized forces)
* **Flow variables** (or generalized flows)

**Energy** is typically:
* **Effort × Flow** integrated **over time** and
* **Power** is **Effort × Flow** at any instant.

What I previously called the *driver* is the *effort variable* needed, to make energy flow. Here’s how it matches for different types of energy:

|Domain | Effort | Flow | Power = Effort × Flow|
|---|---|---|---|
|Mechanical (rotational) | Torque (Nm) | Angular velocity (rad/s) | Torque × ω|
|Mechanical (linear) | Force (N) | Velocity (m/s) | Force × v|
|Electrical | Voltage (V) | Current (A) | Voltage × Current|
|Thermal | Temperature difference (ΔT) | Entropy flow (dS/dt) | ΔT × (entropy flow)|
|Hydraulic | Pressure (Pa) | Volumetric flow rate (m³/s) | Pressure × Flow|

With this beeing said, we can now approach to a general **definition** of **resistance**:


    Resistance is the effort needed to make a certain amount of current flow.

### Example with Thermal Resistance

Lets take a water boiler of 80 l capacity, a storage temperature of 70°C and a styrofoam insulation.

The "driving force" or **efford variable** is the **temperature difference**:

$\Delta T = 70^\circ\text{C} - 20^\circ\text{C} = 50\, \text{K}$


With a given surface area and thermal conductivity of styrofoam one can estimate the **thermal resistance** of about 2.86 K/W.

#### The heat loss (power) through the insulation:

$P = \frac{\Delta T}{R_{\text{th}}}$

where


Thus:

$P = \frac{50}{2.857} \approx 17.5\, \text{W}$

The heater loses about 17.5 Watts continuously just to maintain the 70°C water against 20°C surroundings.

To match the structure above:

* **Temperature difference** $\Delta T$ is the effort variable
* **Heat loss** $P_\text{th}$ is the flow variable

* **Thermal resistance** $R_\text{th}$ is the "difficulty" or "obstacle" to overcome

#### The energy lost over 24 h:

$E = P \times t$

where:
- $P = 17.5\, \text{W}$
- $t = 24\, \text{h} = 86400\, \text{s}$

Thus:

$E = 17.5\, \text{W} \times 86400\, \text{s} = 1,512,000\, \text{J} = 1,512\, \text{kJ}$


Convert to kilowatt-hours:

$E = \frac{1,512\, \text{kJ}}{3600\, \text{kJ/kWh}} \approx 0.42\, \text{kWh/day}$


## Electrical Resistance

This matches the structure above, where:

* Voltage is the effort variable,
* Current is the flow variable,
* Resistance is the "difficulty" or "obstacle" you need to overcome.
