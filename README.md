## Understanding Electronics
Most people I have met, including lecturers at universities, define the understanding of electronics as the **sum** of certain **rules** and **laws**, such as *Kirchhoff's circuit laws* or *Ohm's law*, where the latter can be seen as the E=mc<sup>2</sup> of electronics.

But is that enough? From my experience, to know **when** to **apply** such a **rule**, is a **precondition** to its successful application and needs a **deeper** understanding of the **underlying** matter itself. Further, there are often **multiple** ways to **solve** a certain **problem**, such as determining the value of a resistor in your circuit. Finally we need a certain **intuition** what **tools** are applicable and in which **order** to apply them. I call these rules and laws our **tool box** and they can be learned. But the intuition comes from **experience** and **practise** - and it **roots** in the **understanding** of certain **fundamentals**.

The **aim** of these **lectures** is to **provide** a solid **foundation**, teach the **tools** and help **build** this **intuition** that gives you the **confidence** to **master** your own **projects**. Practical **application** is in the **foreground** and a permanent companion throughout the sessions.
